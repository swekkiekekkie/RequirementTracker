# Test Plan for Language Server

This document outlines the test plan for the Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in the RequirementTracker project. The LSP server provides language-agnostic support for controlled language comments/annotations placed inside multiline comments.

## Test Cases

### 1. Initialization

**Objective**: Verify that the LSP server initializes correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Start the LSP server.
2. Check the server logs for initialization messages.

**Expected Result**: The server should initialize without errors and log the initialization messages.

### 2. Basic LSP Features

**Objective**: Test the basic LSP features such as `initialize`, `textDocument/didOpen`, and `textDocument/didChange`.

**Steps**:
1. Open a text document in the editor.
2. Make changes to the document.
3. Check the server logs for `textDocument/didOpen` and `textDocument/didChange` messages.

**Expected Result**: The server should log the `textDocument/didOpen` and `textDocument/didChange` messages without errors.

### 3. Detecting Language from File Extension

**Objective**: Verify that the LSP server detects the language from the file extension and looks up the corresponding multiline comment syntax.

**Steps**:
1. Open a TypeScript file (`.ts`) in the editor.
2. Open a Python file (`.py`) in the editor.
3. Open a Java file (`.java`) in the editor.

**Expected Result**: The server should correctly detect the language from the file extension and use the appropriate multiline comment syntax for each file type.

### 4. Parsing Multiline Comments

**Objective**: Test the LSP server's ability to parse controlled language comments/annotations placed inside multiline comments.

**Steps**:
1. Add multiline comments with controlled language annotations in a TypeScript file.
2. Add multiline comments with controlled language annotations in a Python file.
3. Add multiline comments with controlled language annotations in a Java file.

**Expected Result**: The server should correctly parse the contents of the multiline comments and log the parsed annotations.

### 5. Error Handling

**Objective**: Verify that the LSP server handles errors gracefully.

**Steps**:
1. Introduce syntax errors in a TypeScript file.
2. Introduce syntax errors in a Python file.
3. Introduce syntax errors in a Java file.

**Expected Result**: The server should log the errors without crashing and provide meaningful error messages.

## Conclusion

This test plan covers the essential test cases for the LSP implementation in the RequirementTracker project. By following this plan, we can ensure that the LSP server functions correctly and provides the intended language-agnostic support for controlled language comments/annotations.
