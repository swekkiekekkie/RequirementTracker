## NFR-3: Scalability

- **Description**: The system shall handle large codebases and complex projects efficiently, with performance degradation limited to a linear increase relative to project size.
- **Rationale**: Ensures the tool remains functional and responsive as project size grows.
- **Metrics**: The system should scale to handle projects with up to 100,000 lines of code while maintaining response times within 150% of the baseline (10,000-line codebase). Memory usage should not exceed 2 GB during analysis.

## NFR-4: Compatibility

- **Description**: The system shall be compatible with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and integrate with popular development environments.
- **Rationale**: Broad compatibility ensures accessibility for diverse development teams.
- **Metrics**: The system should run without critical compatibility issues on each OS, and pass compatibility testing with IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, and Atom.

## NFR-5: Maintainability

- **Description**: The system codebase shall be modular, well-documented, and follow coding standards to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.
- **Rationale**: Improves the ease of future updates, bug fixes, and new feature additions.
- **Metrics**: The codebase should achieve at least 80% documentation coverage. Cyclomatic complexity should remain under 15 for all critical functions. Module dependency changes should be minimized (no more than 10% of modules require modification for a feature addition).

## NFR-6: Reliability

- **Description**: The system shall operate consistently under normal conditions, minimizing downtime and avoiding critical failures.
- **Rationale**: Reliability ensures trust in the tool’s output and prevents interruptions in workflow.
- **Metrics**: System uptime should be at least 99% during active development periods. No more than one critical error per 1,000 hours of operation. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) should exceed 500 hours.

## NFR-7: Security

- **Description**: The system shall protect sensitive project information, prevent unauthorized access, and operate securely within the development environment.
- **Rationale**: Maintains data security, especially when handling proprietary project information.
- **Metrics**: The system should have zero critical security vulnerabilities and pass security scans with no high-severity issues. All third-party dependencies should meet current security standards.

## NFR-8: Extensibility

- **Description**: The system architecture shall support future enhancements and the addition of new features with minimal disruption to the existing codebase.
- **Rationale**: Extensibility ensures that the tool can evolve as user needs change.
- **Metrics**: New features should be implementable with changes to less than 5% of the existing codebase. The system should support plugins or APIs for extensions.

## NFR-9: Accessibility

- **Description**: The system shall meet accessibility standards to support use by individuals with disabilities.
- **Rationale**: Compliance with accessibility standards increases usability for all users.
- **Metrics**: The system should comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, including keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility.

## NFR-10: Legal and Compliance

- **Description**: The system shall comply with relevant legal and licensing requirements, especially concerning third-party dependencies and data privacy.
- **Rationale**: Legal compliance reduces risk and ensures responsible usage of software components.
- **Metrics**: All third-party components are verified for proper licensing, and compliance audits report no critical issues.

## NFR-11: Internationalization and Localization

- **Description**: The system shall support internationalization to facilitate future localization into multiple languages.
- **Rationale**: Internationalization enables use by a global audience and facilitates adaptation to new languages.
- **Metrics**: The system can be localized into at least two languages without modifications to the codebase. All text strings are separated into resource files.

## NFR-12: Support and Documentation

- **Description**: The system shall provide comprehensive user support and documentation to help users set up, configure, and troubleshoot effectively.
- **Rationale**: Good support and documentation reduce the learning curve and enhance user experience.
- **Metrics**: User documentation covers 100% of features. Support satisfaction rating should be at least 4 out of 5 based on user feedback.

## NFR-13: Integration Capability

- **Description**: The system shall integrate seamlessly with existing development tools and workflows, supporting automation and continuous integration.
- **Rationale**: Integration capabilities enhance usability within existing development environments.
- **Metrics**: The system should support integration with at least three major CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI). User feedback on integration ease should be rated at least 4 out of 5.

## NFR-14: LSP Performance and Compatibility

- **Description**: The Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation shall perform efficiently and be compatible with various programming languages.
- **Rationale**: Ensures the LSP server enhances the user experience without causing performance issues.
- **Metrics**: The LSP server should initialize within 2 seconds and handle file changes in under 1 second for projects with up to 10,000 lines of code. The LSP server should support at least three different programming languages.

## NFR-15: LSP Language Agnosticism and Multiline Comment Handling

- **Description**: The LSP server shall be language agnostic and handle controlled language comments/annotations placed inside multiline comments.
- **Rationale**: Enhances the user experience by detecting the language from the file extension and parsing the contents of multiline comments.
- **Metrics**: The LSP server should correctly detect the language from the file extension and parse multiline comments for at least three different programming languages.
