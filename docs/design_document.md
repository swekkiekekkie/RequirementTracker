# Design Document

## Introduction

**RequirementTracker** is a tool and specification designed to standardize the writing and tracking of functional and non-functional requirements, test plans, and user stories. It provides a labeling system that enables coverage tracking across all stages of software development.

## Objectives

- **Standardization**: Create a unified format for documenting requirements, test plans, and user stories.
- **Coverage Tracking**: Implement tooling to check and enforce coverage across documentation, code, and tests.
- **Automation**: Generate prompts for AI tools like GitHub Copilot to assist in development.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Utilize a JSDoc-like format targeting TypeScript for seamless integration.
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically produce comprehensive documentation and graphs from labeled information.

## System Overview

The system consists of the following key components:

1. **Labeling System**: A standardized method to label and link different artifacts in the development process.
2. **Parser and Analyzer**: Tools to parse labeled documents and analyze coverage.
3. **Documentation Generator**: Generates human-readable documentation and visual representations.
4. **AI Prompt Generator**: Creates prompts for AI-assisted coding tools.

## Components Detail

### 1. Labeling System

- **Format**: Utilize a JSDoc-like syntax for annotations in TypeScript.
- **Scope**: Labels apply to requirements, design elements, code, tests, and documentation.
- **Uniqueness**: Each label is unique and traceable throughout the project lifecycle.

### 2. Parser and Analyzer

- **Function**: Parse the labeled documents and source code to extract relevant information.
- **Coverage Analysis**: Determine the coverage of requirements in design, code, and tests.

### 3. Documentation Generator

- **Output**: Generate markdown documents and graphs illustrating the relationships and coverage.
- **Tools**: Use libraries like D3.js or Graphviz for graph generation.

### 4. AI Prompt Generator

- **Integration**: Works with AI tools to enhance development efficiency.
- **Function**: Generates context-aware prompts based on the existing documentation and codebase.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Define Labeling Standards**: Establish the syntax and rules for labeling.
2. **Develop Parser**: Create a parser to read and interpret the labels.
3. **Build Analyzer**: Implement the coverage analysis logic.
4. **Create Generators**: Develop tools for documentation and AI prompt generation.
5. **Testing**: Write test cases to validate each component.
6. **Integration**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
7. **Documentation**: Document the system for users and contributors.

## Conclusion

By providing a standardized approach to documentation and coverage tracking, RequirementTracker aims to enhance software quality and development efficiency.
