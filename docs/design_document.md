# Design Document

## Introduction

**RequirementTracker** is a tool and specification framework that standardizes the documentation and tracking of functional and non-functional requirements, test plans, and user stories in software development. It aims to enhance software quality by enabling comprehensive coverage tracking, ensuring that requirements, code, and tests align with documented objectives.

## Objectives

- **Standardization**: Define a unified format for documenting requirements, test plans, and user stories, allowing easy parsing and analysis.
- **Coverage Tracking**: Implement tooling to check and enforce coverage across documentation, code, and tests, highlighting any gaps.
- **Automation**: Generate context-aware prompts for AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) to streamline development tasks.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Use a JSDoc-like format targeting TypeScript to integrate seamlessly into the development workflow.
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically produce user-friendly documentation and visualizations of relationships and coverage.

## Success Metrics

- **Standardization**: Achieve 100% consistency in documentation format across requirements, tests, and code.
- **Coverage**: Ensure 95% or higher coverage across requirements, design, tests, and code.
- **Automation Impact**: Reduce manual documentation and code coverage tasks by 30% through AI-generated prompts.
- **TypeScript Compatibility**: Support TypeScript projects with zero compatibility issues reported.
- **Documentation Quality**: Generate visual documentation that meets usability standards, verified by user feedback with a satisfaction rate of 90% or higher.

## System Overview

The RequirementTracker system consists of the following components:

1. **Labeling System**: A standardized annotation format that uniquely labels and links different artifacts in the development process.
2. **Parser and Analyzer**: Tools to interpret labels and analyze coverage across requirements, design documents, code, and tests.
3. **Documentation Generator**: Generates human-readable documentation and visual representations, such as graphs of dependencies and relationships.
4. **AI Prompt Generator**: Creates context-aware prompts for AI-assisted coding tools.
5. **Language Server Protocol (LSP) Implementation**: A language server that provides language-agnostic support for controlled language comments/annotations placed inside multiline comments.

### 1. Labeling System

- **Format**: Utilizes a JSDoc-like syntax for annotations in TypeScript, allowing integration into code comments, documentation, and test cases.
- **Scope**: Labels apply to requirements, design elements, code, tests, and documentation.
- **Uniqueness**: Ensures that each label is unique and traceable throughout the project lifecycle, supporting hierarchical structures where user requirements relate to design, code, and tests.

### 2. Parser and Analyzer

- **Function**: Parses labeled documents and source code to extract and interpret relevant information.
- **Coverage Analysis**: Measures the coverage of requirements across design, code, and tests, identifying areas that need attention.
- **Dependencies**: Utilizes existing TypeScript parsers and may depend on TypeScript-specific AST libraries for optimal integration.

### 3. Documentation Generator

- **Output**: Generates markdown documents and visual representations of relationships and coverage across requirements, design, and code.
- **Tools**: Uses libraries like D3.js or Graphviz for graph generation and visualization of dependency structures.
- **Customization**: Supports customizable templates for different levels of documentation detail.

### 4. AI Prompt Generator

- **Integration**: Works with AI coding tools to enhance development efficiency by generating prompts related to specific requirements, tests, or documentation items.
- **Function**: Analyzes context and generates useful prompts for tasks such as code writing, refactoring, and test creation, reducing manual effort.

### 5. Language Server Protocol (LSP) Implementation

- **Purpose**: The LSP server provides language-agnostic support for controlled language comments/annotations placed inside multiline comments.
- **Benefits**: Enhances the user experience by detecting the language from the file extension and parsing the contents of multiline comments.
- **Implementation**: The LSP server will be implemented using the `vscode-languageserver` library and will include handlers for basic LSP features like `initialize`, `textDocument/didOpen`, and `textDocument/didChange`.
- **Controlled Language Comments**: The LSP server will detect the language from the file extension and look up the corresponding multiline comment syntax to parse the controlled language comments/annotations.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Define Labeling Standards**: Establish the syntax and rules for labeling, including examples and templates for common cases.
2. **Develop Parser**: Create a parser to read and interpret labels in TypeScript code, documentation, and test files.
3. **Build Analyzer**: Implement coverage analysis logic to measure and report coverage across requirements, design, code, and tests.
4. **Create Generators**: Develop tools for documentation and AI prompt generation.
5. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to validate each component, with a focus on accurate parsing and coverage analysis.
6. **Integration**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly, creating an easy-to-use workflow for developers.
7. **Documentation**: Document the system thoroughly for users and contributors, including examples and troubleshooting tips.

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. **Label Uniqueness Across Large Projects**: To prevent label conflicts in larger projects, implement validation checks and consider a label-naming convention that includes a namespace or category prefix.
2. **Complex Coverage Analysis**: Ensuring accurate coverage analysis in complex codebases may be challenging. Address this by using a robust AST parser for TypeScript and providing detailed reports on any uncovered requirements.
3. **Tool Compatibility**: The tool should be compatible across environments. Prioritize compatibility testing for common development environments, and support extensibility for further customization.

## Future Considerations

- **CI/CD Integration**: Consider integration with CI/CD pipelines to automate coverage checks and report generation during build processes.
- **Multi-language Support**: Although initially targeting TypeScript, explore adding support for other languages based on community interest.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Implement advanced visualization features, such as interactive dependency graphs and filtering options, to aid in large-scale projects.

## Conclusion

By providing a standardized approach to documentation and coverage tracking, RequirementTracker aims to enhance software quality and development efficiency. This approach aligns requirements, design, code, and tests, ensuring comprehensive and traceable coverage, with the added benefit of AI-assisted development.
