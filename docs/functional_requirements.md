# Functional Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for the RequirementTracker tool, organized according to the implementation plan's tasks.

---

## FR-1: Define Labeling Standards

- **FR-1.1: Establish Label Syntax**
  - **Description**: Define a standardized syntax for labeling requirements, design elements, tests, and documentation, using a JSDoc-like format.
  - **Rationale**: Consistent syntax ensures ease of parsing and supports integration with TypeScript.

- **FR-1.2: Provide Label Examples**
  - **Description**: Create example templates to demonstrate correct labeling for each artifact type, including requirements, user stories, test cases, and documentation.
  - **Rationale**: Templates guide users in applying the labeling standards correctly and consistently.

- **FR-1.3: Define Label Hierarchy and Scope**
  - **Description**: Establish a hierarchical structure for labels to support parent-child relationships between requirements and their corresponding design, code, and tests.
  - **Rationale**: A hierarchy enables structured tracking across development stages and supports complex projects with interdependent components.

- **FR-1.4: Specify Uniqueness and Namespace Rules**
  - **Description**: Define rules for label uniqueness and optional namespace prefixes to prevent conflicts in large projects.
  - **Rationale**: Unique labels are critical for traceability and coverage analysis across different project artifacts.

- **FR-1.5: Configurable Label Format**
  - **Description**: Allow customization of the label syntax and structure based on project-specific needs.
  - **Rationale**: Different projects may have varying requirements, and configurable labels enhance flexibility.

## FR-2: Develop Parser

- **FR-2.1: Parse TypeScript Code and Documentation**
  - **Description**: Implement parsing capabilities to identify and read labels within TypeScript code, documentation, and test files.
  - **Rationale**: Parsing TypeScript-specific annotations allows seamless integration with development workflows.

- **FR-2.2: Extract Labeled Information into Structured Data**
  - **Description**: Convert parsed labels into structured data formats (e.g., JSON) to support analysis and documentation generation.
  - **Rationale**: Structured data enables efficient data handling and analysis for the tool's subsequent stages.

- **FR-2.3: Validate Label Syntax and Structure**
  - **Description**: Ensure that each parsed label adheres to the defined syntax and structure, providing warnings or errors for malformed labels.
  - **Rationale**: Syntax validation enforces labeling standards and prevents parsing errors in subsequent stages.

- **FR-2.4: Support for Label Namespaces**
  - **Description**: Ensure that the parser recognizes and respects namespaces, if defined, to avoid label conflicts.
  - **Rationale**: Namespace support allows users to organize labels systematically, especially in larger projects.

- **FR-2.5: Incremental Parsing**
  - **Description**: Support incremental parsing to handle large codebases efficiently without re-parsing the entire project.
  - **Rationale**: Incremental parsing optimizes performance and reduces processing time.

## FR-3: Build Analyzer

- **FR-3.1: Coverage Analysis for Requirements**
  - **Description**: Analyze the coverage of requirements across design, code, and test artifacts, identifying any gaps or unlinked elements.
  - **Rationale**: Coverage analysis ensures comprehensive implementation and testing of all documented requirements.

- **FR-3.2: Generate Coverage Reports**
  - **Description**: Create reports detailing coverage status for each requirement, showing which elements are covered in design, code, tests, and documentation.
  - **Rationale**: Clear reports help developers identify missing or incomplete coverage across project components.

- **FR-3.3: Detect Label Conflicts and Duplicates**
  - **Description**: Identify any duplicate or conflicting labels, especially within large or namespace-divided projects.
  - **Rationale**: Prevents labeling conflicts that could compromise the accuracy of coverage analysis.

- **FR-3.4: Cross-Referencing Between Artifacts**
  - **Description**: Enable cross-referencing between different artifact types (e.g., link test cases to requirements).
  - **Rationale**: Cross-referencing enhances traceability and ensures that tests, code, and documentation align with the requirements.

- **FR-3.5: Hierarchical Coverage Analysis**
  - **Description**: Support hierarchical coverage tracking, enabling developers to see both high-level and detailed coverage across nested labels.
  - **Rationale**: Hierarchical analysis aids in understanding coverage for complex, multi-level requirements.

- **FR-3.6: Provide Configurable Coverage Metrics**
  - **Description**: Allow configuration of minimum coverage thresholds and customizable metrics based on project needs.
  - **Rationale**: Configurable metrics let teams define their own standards for acceptable coverage.

## FR-4: Create Generators

- **FR-4.1: Documentation Generator**
  - **Description**: Automatically generate human-readable documentation from parsed and structured data, covering requirements, design, and tests.
  - **Rationale**: Automated documentation generation reduces manual effort and ensures up-to-date information for users.

- **FR-4.2: Visual Graph Generator**
  - **Description**: Generate visual graphs showing dependencies and relationships between requirements, design elements, code, and tests.
  - **Rationale**: Visual representation enhances comprehension, especially for complex projects.

- **FR-4.3: AI Prompt Generator for Development Support**
  - **Description**: Create prompts based on labeled data for AI-assisted tools like GitHub Copilot to suggest code, documentation, or test creation.
  - **Rationale**: AI prompts streamline development tasks and ensure alignment with documented requirements.

- **FR-4.4: Template-Based Documentation Customization**
  - **Description**: Provide templates for customizing generated documentation and visualizations to meet specific team preferences.
  - **Rationale**: Customizable templates increase flexibility and allow teams to tailor outputs to their needs.

- **FR-4.5: Export and Integration Options**
  - **Description**: Enable exports of generated documentation and graphs in multiple formats (e.g., Markdown, HTML) for integration with other tools.
  - **Rationale**: Export options support integration with existing documentation platforms and tools.

## FR-5: Testing

- **FR-5.1: Unit Tests for Parser and Analyzer**
  - **Description**: Develop unit tests to validate the parser's and analyzer’s accuracy and adherence to the labeling syntax.
  - **Rationale**: Unit tests ensure each component performs as expected, improving reliability.

- **FR-5.2: Integration Tests for Labeling and Coverage Tracking**
  - **Description**: Test the interaction between the labeling system, parser, analyzer, and generators to verify end-to-end functionality.
  - **Rationale**: Integration testing ensures that components work together seamlessly.

- **FR-5.3: Performance Testing for Large Codebases**
  - **Description**: Assess the system’s performance and response times when processing large projects.
  - **Rationale**: Performance testing ensures scalability and responsiveness in real-world scenarios.

- **FR-5.4: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
  - **Description**: Conduct testing with end users to validate the usability and effectiveness of RequirementTracker in actual development workflows.
  - **Rationale**: UAT gathers feedback on usability and helps identify any areas for improvement.
